This is an example of a client-side application implemented using [Rosmaro](https://rosmaro.js.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

A _Rosmaro model_ is responsible for handling changes of behavior (and data), and _React_ renders the view. 

[Rosmaro Editor](https://rosmaro.js.org/editor) was used to draw the _graph.json_ file.
[Rosmaro for React](https://github.com/lukaszmakuch/rosmaro-react) was used to integrate React with Rosmaro.
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used to bootstrap this demo.

There is __1 IF statement__ responsible for the logic.
